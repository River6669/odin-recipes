<h2>Description</h2>    
    <p>A delicious and fluffy white bread, perfect for sandwiches and toast, if it lasts that long. It will be tempting to eat it with your hands straight out of the pan.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1cup warm water, between 98&deg;<sup>F</sup> and 115&deg;<sup>F</sup></li>
        <li>2 1/4tsp dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/3cup white granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2TBSP oil or butter</li>
        <li>3cups bread flour</li>
        <li>3/4tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>note</b> If you do not have bread flour you can use all-purpose, however it will have a very different texture to most sandwich breads. This is why I reccomend bread flour.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Proof yeast in warm water with 1tsp sugar for 10 minutes. It should be foamy</li>
        <li>Add oil and the rest of the sugar to your yeast mixture.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine your bread flour and salt</li>
        <li>Add your yeast mixture to your flour and combine until a ball is formed</li>
        <li>Knead your dough for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Proof for 60-90 minutes or until doubled in size</li>
        <li>Flatten, stretch, and roll dough, place into a greased bread pan.</li>
        <li>Proof for 60-90 minutes until doubled in size</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350&deg;<sup>F</sup></li>
        <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes until top is golden brown</li>
        <li>Let rest upside down until cool before cutting for best results</li>
    </ol>
<p>This recipe can be used as a base for other breads very easily. Experiment on your own with different flavorings and inclusions. You will be suprised by what you can come up with.</p>
